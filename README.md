### Binary Translator For Facebook
Copy and Paste text_to_binary.js into the chrome developer tools on Facebook and run translate() to read Binary and convert() to convert your inputted text into a Facebook messenger window to binary before submitting it.

#### Constraints
- Only reads binary in the form of 8 bits and space in between
- translate all messages within the messenger window, this creates blank messages if not formatted as above
- Could have not used jquery, but yeah
